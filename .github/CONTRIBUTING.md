2. **Develop Your Change**: Ensure it complies with [OCCT Coding Rules](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt_contribution__coding_rules.html).
3. **Build and Verify**: Build the modified version of OCCT and verify it works as expected. Consider creating a test case.

5. **Push Your Change**: Push your change to the Git repository in a branch with a name starting with "CR" followed by the issue ID, then switch the issue to Resolved.
