//! Class provides a collection of prime numbers.
//!
//! This class is used to store a collection of prime numbers that are used as
//! consecutive steps for the size of an array of buckets in a map. The prime
//! numbers are chosen to minimize the probability of having the same hash codes
//! for different map items. The class also provides a method to find the next
//! prime number greater than or equal to a given number.

  //! The array of prime numbers used as consecutive steps for
  //! size of array of buckets in the map.
  //! The prime numbers are used for array size with the hope that this will
  //! lead to less probability of having the same hash codes for
  //! different map items (note that all hash codes are modulo that size).
  //! The value of each next step is chosen to be ~2 times greater than previous.
  //! Though this could be thought as too much, actually the amount of
  //! memory overhead in that case is only ~15% as compared with total size of
  //! all auxiliary data structures (each map node takes ~24 bytes),
  //! and this proves to pay off in performance (see OCC13189).
  //!
  //! The following are Pierpont primes, prime numbers of the form 2^u * 3^v + 1
